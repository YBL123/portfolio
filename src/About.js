        I have recently made a career change by enrolling in General Assemblyâ€™s Software Engineering Immersive course.</p>
      <br />
      <p className="home-about-text">
        I was first introduced to programming through my partner. Seeing how ever-evolving it is and the endless possibilities of what I could create, intrigued and excited me. What I love most about  my previous career in photography/art is the process of concept to creation. To me programming follows the same process.
